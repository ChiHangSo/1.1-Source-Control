1. https://github.com/MiguelVis/2048.git

- I found this git every interesting, ever since I knew about the game of 2048, I've been interested in
how the system goes with this hard yet simple system between the two. Even though it's a clone I think this
brings out it's characteristics of the game. A game like this people forget how the simple games were made
and looking back at this, will definitely show how games were made back then.

2. https://github.com/ManoloiuAlexandru/Popular-games-and-Small-projects.git

- I chose this as my second choice because nowadays simple games like these won't be played often, blackjack
is an exception but that exception is that it's not really casual played. I've done the blackjack game in PG2
but there are other games here that let me see games like Hangman and how it was programmed.

3. https://github.com/rosbel/TicTacToeWithFriends.git

- TicTacToe, a classic game. I feel like if given the time and dedication to actually learn the ropes of
learning to program TicTacToe with windows form I feel like I can make a game. Reasoning on this is that
I can create a game and send it to my friends to play a game I coded.

4. https://github.com/gameplay3d/gameplay.git

- I found this repo interesting because later on the month my team and I will be making a game engine, so
exploring this genre this far would do me good and follow some steps from those programmers that were in my
shoes.
